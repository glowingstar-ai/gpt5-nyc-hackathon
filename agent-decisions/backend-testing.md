# Backend test coverage decisions

- Added `tests/test_emotion_services.py` to exercise every branch of the emotion analysis stack, including helper utilities, analyzer heuristics, API dependencies, and configuration code. The goal was to reach 100% line coverage for `app` modules.
- Verified default FastAPI routes (root, health, emotion) via `TestClient` to ensure runtime wiring stays covered without running the ASGI server.
- Used Python's built-in `trace` module (`python -m trace --count --coverdir=tracecov --module pytest`) to confirm no uncovered lines remain because third-party coverage plugins could not be installed in the offline environment.
- Cleared cached settings inside configuration-focused tests to avoid cross-test pollution while still exercising the lru_cache decorators.
