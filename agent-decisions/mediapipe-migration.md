# MediaPipe Face Landmarker Migration

## Context
- The frontend previously imported `@tensorflow-models/face-landmarks-detection`, which in turn requires `@tensorflow/tfjs-core`. The dependency chain caused the build failure shown in the provided screenshot because the TensorFlow JS core package was not installed during the Next.js compilation.
- The user requested a solution that does not rely on TensorFlow-based models and asked for a better alternative model after researching options.

## Decision
- Switched the facial landmark detection stack to the MediaPipe Tasks Face Landmarker (`@mediapipe/tasks-vision`). The task API wraps the same high-quality face mesh model but ships as a pure WebAssembly bundle, removing the TensorFlow runtime dependency entirely.
- Pinned the WASM bundle (`@mediapipe/tasks-vision@0.10.4`) and referenced the official hosted `.task` model from Google Storage to ensure deterministic loading in production builds.
- Reworked the video-processing loop to consume normalized landmarks from the new API and convert them into pixel coordinates before calculating smile, brow raise, and other custom metrics.

## Rationale
- MediaPipe Tasks is the recommended successor to the legacy TensorFlow.js integration, according to the Google AI/MediaPipe documentation, and it avoids the large TensorFlow payload. It is also optimized for real-time, on-device inference in browsers.
- By pinning explicit CDN URLs for the WASM runtime and model asset, the application can download the artifacts without bundling them, keeping the Next.js build lightweight.
- Updating the measurement logic to use normalized landmarks keeps the existing UI logic intact while ensuring numerical stability (e.g., treating the very first frameâ€™s head movement as zero to avoid spikes).

## Follow-up
- The development container cannot currently download the npm package (`@mediapipe/tasks-vision`) because of a 403 from the npm registry. Once network access is restored, run `npm install` in `frontend/` to materialize the dependency in `node_modules` before building locally.
