# Realtime conversation screenshot capture

## Context
- Feature: realtime conversation panel (`frontend/components/realtime-conversation.tsx`).
- Goal: ensure a fresh vision frame is uploaded to the backend when the user starts a conversation so the backend has up-to-date context.

## Decision
- Updated the `startConversation` flow to `await` the optional `onShareVisionFrame` callback.
- Wrapped the awaited call in `try/catch` to surface non-blocking console warnings instead of uncaught promise rejections.

## Rationale
- Awaiting the callback guarantees the screenshot upload request is dispatched before negotiating the realtime session.
- Preserves existing error handling semantics while avoiding unhandled promise rejections and making the intent explicit.

## Alternatives considered
- Leaving the fire-and-forget invocation. Rejected because the backend might complete session negotiation before the upload finishes, leading to missing context.
- Forcing screenshot capture regardless of capture session state. Not pursued to avoid race conditions when the capture session is inactive.
