# GPT-5 Realtime Companion (Plasmo build)

This directory contains a minimal Chrome side panel extension that lets you
start a realtime conversation with the GPT-5 hackathon assistant. The UI lives
inside the side panel: press **Start** to mint an ephemeral session via the
backend's `/api/v1/realtime/session` endpoint and complete the WebRTC handshake
against OpenAI's realtime API. Once connected, you can speak to the assistant or
send text prompts; transcripts stream back into the panel in real time.

## Local development

1. Ensure the FastAPI backend in this repository is running locally so the
   `/api/v1/realtime/session` route is reachable (defaults to
   `http://localhost:8000`).
2. From this directory, install dependencies (`npm install` or `pnpm install`)
   and run `npm run dev` to build the extension in watch mode.
3. In Chrome, open `chrome://extensions`, enable **Developer mode**, and choose
   **Load unpacked**. Select the `build/chrome-mv3-dev` directory generated by
   Plasmo.
4. Open the side panel from the extension toolbar button and press **Start** to
   begin a call. Use the input at the bottom to override the API base URL if the
   backend is hosted elsewhere.

To produce a production build, run `npm run build`; the output appears in
`build/chrome-mv3-prod`.
